Thanks for using my calculator @d.vetriak

@Artem Hrechanychenko
Think about how to make it more adaptive to input values
If one for numbers is float - then use float for end result as datatype

Also think about how to return to initial state of program when action is finished
1) 1+1 = 2 → return to input numbers or exit
2) 4/3 = 1.33 → return to input of new numbers or exit
